!TESTING THE TENABALIBITY OF AN EQUALITY CONSTRAINT ON THE ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE OF THE RESPECTIVE INDIRECT EFFECTS
!MODEL CONSTRAINT:
!NEW (MED1 MED2);
!MED1 = a1*b1;
!MED2 = a2*b2;
!MODEL TEST:
!0=MED1+MED2;

!TESTING THE EQUALITY CONSTRAINTS THIS WAY PRODUCES THE SAME MODEL-COMPARISON RESULTS AS USING THE RECOMMENDED DIFFTEST PROCEDURE (I CHECKED) BUT IT IS EASIER THIS WAY!
!MODEL CONSTRAINT:
